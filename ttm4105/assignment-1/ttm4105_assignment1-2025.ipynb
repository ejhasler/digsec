    "*Answer:* At low frequencies. The spectrum is largest in the 50-200 Hz region (kick+bass fundamentals).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.1.2 [2 points]:** The audio file contains simultaneous sounds from three instruments: drums, bass, and voice. Which type of filter is appropriate for isolating the bass frequencies? Specify the cutoff frequencies required for this isolation. Adjust the parameters to determine the optimal solution and document the results. <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* To isolate the bass, a low-pass filter is appropriate, since bass energy lies in the lower en of the spectrum. By setting the high cutoff frequency around 180 - 200 Hz, the filter retains the fundemental range of the bass and kick drum while removing most of the voice and higher-frequency drum components. \n",

    "*Answer:* Tested a band-pass setup to keep the vocal + drum content while removing bass. The best results where with band-pass from 250 to 6000 Hz where we got the cleanest isolation of voice and most drum components. tested also with a band pass from 250 - 12000 Hz where we got a brighter version, vocals was still clear. In the end, a band pass between 250 - 6000 Hz is a good choice for balanced voice + drums isolation. For a brighter drum sound, we can use 250 - 12 000 Hz.\n",

Document these changes, describe your observations and the auditory differences between lower and higher cutoff frequencies. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* Filtering improves audio quality by removing unwanted frequencies such as low-en rumble, electrical hum, or high-frequency hiss. It helps isolate instruments or voices, reduces masking, and makes signals clearer for both listening and further processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If filtering is excessive, important parts of the signal are lost: low cutoffs make the sound muffled and reduce speech intelligibility, while too much high-frequency removal elimnates brightness and naturalness. If filtering is insufficient, noise and irrelevant frequencies remain, leading to a muddy or unclear mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the provided code a 1500 Hz cutoff, most of the mid and high contnet was removed. The result sounded very muffled, where vocals lost clarity, cymbals and hi-hats disappeared, and only bass and lower mids were audible. At a 10 000 Hz cutoff, only the very high \"air\" frequencies were removed. The sound stayed clear and natural, but slightly less bright.\n",

    "*Answer:* To see if the initial parameters occur, we can use Nyquist frequency formula f_nyquist = f_s / 2 => 35/2 = 17.5 Hz. This means any true signal frequency above 17.5 Hz will alias when sampled at 35 Hz. Since the original signal is 20 Hz, it's above Nyqyist, so then aliasing will occur.\n",

    "*Answer:* Sampling the signal the Nyquist limit made us change the sample_rate = 40, because Nyquist limit for a 20Hz signal is f_s => 2f_max = 40. Observing at Graph 2 where 20Hz signal sampled at 40Hz, we can observe that the samples (black dots) line up twice per cycle of the 20 Hz sine wave. This confirms we are sampling at the Nyquist limit, with only 2 samples per period.\n",

    "**Q1.2.3 [3 points]:** What differences can be observed in the spectral analysis of both audio signals? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* At 8 kHz, the spectrogram shows content cleanly up to 4 kHz, which is the Nyquist limit for that sampling rate. In contrast, at 2 kHz, everything above 1 kHz (its Nyquist frequency) is folded back into the 0–1 kHz range. This produces mirrored, downward ramps and extra stripes below 1 kHz, which are classic alias images of the sweep as it crosses the Nyquist frequency. While the 8 kHz spectrogram displays one clean rising sweep with its expected harmonics, the 2 kHz version contains reflected components that distort the spectrum. As a result, energy that should appear above 1 kHz is reflected back into the lower frequencies (for example, a true 1.2 kHz tone is mirrored to 800 Hz), creating denser and more inharmonic components. The 8 kHz signal therefore maintains a higher spectral centroid and looks cleaner, while the 2 kHz signal shows a lower apparent centroid with extra lines and noise-like filling due to aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.2.4 [3 points]:** What auditory differences can be perceived when comparing both audio signals? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* When listening to the two signals, the differences are clear. In the 2 kHz version, as the sweep crosses 1 kHz, the pitch bends in the wrong direction or seems to “reflect,” leading to strange warbles that are not present in the 8 kHz version. The lower-rate signal also introduces additional inharmonic tones, giving it a buzzy or metallic texture, whereas the 8 kHz version sounds cleaner and more natural. Furthermore, the 2 kHz signal loses much of the high-frequency brightness that is still audible at 8 kHz, because those higher frequencies are not preserved but instead folded down into lower ranges, misrepresenting the true sound.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Q1.3.1 [2 points]:**  How does the number of quantization levels impact the resolution of a signal?<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* The number of quantization levels directly determines the resolution of the signal. More levels mean that the amplitude axis is divided into finer intervals, allowing each sample to be represented more accurately. This reduces quantization error and increases the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR). Conversely, fewer levels result in coarser resolution, larger rounding errors, and more audible distortion or noise in the reconstructed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.3.2 [2 points]:** What methods can be employed to reduce quantization error? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* Quantization error can be reduced by increasing the number of quantization bits, which raises the resolution. Dithering can also be applied by adding low-level noise before quantization to mask and randomize distortion. Noise shaping is another technique that redistributes quantization noise into less perceptible frequency ranges. Oversampling combined with filtering can reduce effective noise, and non-uniform quantization methods like μ-law or A-law companding allocate more resolution to the most perceptually important amplitude ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.3.3 [2 points]:** Under what circumstances is non-uniform quantization more advantageous than uniform quantization? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* Non-uniform quantization is more advantageous when the signal amplitude distribution is not uniform, especially when low-amplitude values carry more perceptual or informational importance, as in speech signals. In these cases, companding (such as μ-law or A-law) provides more quantization levels near zero amplitude, improving perceived quality without increasing the overall bit rate. This makes non-uniform quantization ideal for applications like telephony and voice coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.3.4 [2 points]:**  What are the disadvantages associated with non-uniform quantization?<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* The main disadvantages of non-uniform quantization are its increased complexity and the requirement for matched encoding and decoding schemes. If the companding function is not applied consistently, signal distortion occurs. Additionally, non-uniform quantization introduces a non-linear amplitude mapping, which can complicate subsequent signal processing tasks such as mixing or filtering. It may also introduce bias when used on signals that do not match the assumed distribution, leading to less efficient use of quantization levels compared to uniform quantization in such cases.\n"

    "**Q1.3.5 [2 points]:** Change the initial parameter using different quantization bits. Present the results. <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* When the number of quantization bits is reduced from 16 (original) to 12, 8, and 4 bits, the audio quality decreases progressively. At 12 bits, the signal still sounds close to the original, with only a slight background hiss. At 8 bits, the hiss becomes more noticeable, and some details in the voice are lost. At 4 bits, the signal is heavily degraded, with strong distortion and a “robotic” sound. The plots confirm this: the waveforms at lower bit depths show coarser steps, and the zoomed-in graphs highlight the loss of resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.3.6 [2 points]:** How does reducing the number of quantization levels affect the signal? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* Reducing the number of quantization levels increases the step size between representable values, which makes the waveform less accurate. This increases quantization error and raises the noise floor.

For professional audio, higher bit depths (16–24 bits) are needed, while for speech coding in telephony, fewer bits with companding can still provide acceptable quality.\n",

    "**Q1.3.8 [2 points]:** Which type of signal, uniform or non-uniform, shows a better quality? What differences can be observed between them? Why is this type of quantization more effective for this particular audio signal? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:*For speech signals, non-uniform quantization generally provides better quality than uniform quantization. This is because non-uniform schemes (such as μ-law or A-law) allocate more levels to small amplitudes, which preserves soft sounds and speech nuances where the human ear is most sensitive. Compared to uniform quantization, non-uniform quantization reduces the audible noise in quiet sections, producing clearer and more natural audio. This makes it more effective for voice recordings, where preserving intelligibility at low bit rates is crucial."

Consequently, a received I/Q value could deviate by 89° yet fall within the correct decision boundary (as depicted in Fig. 2.7.3). In QPSK, the I/Q plane is divided into four sections, with decision boundaries present along both the I- and Q-axes, allowing less room for error. Therefore, in QPSK, a symbol received with a phase deviation of 89° would be misinterpreted by the receiver, resulting in a symbol error.\n",

    "A modulation scheme that alters both the amplitude and phase is called Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). In QAM, the constellation diagram represents both amplitude and phase information. The points in the constellation are typically arranged in a rectangular grid pattern, with signal points located at various combinations of amplitude and phase. For example, in 16-QAM, there are 16 signal points arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each point in the grid represents a unique combination of both amplitude and phase, allowing for the transmission of four bits per symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting both the amplitude and phase of the signal, QAM modulation schemes can achieve higher data rates and spectral efficiency compared to simpler modulation schemes like PSK or ASK."

    "## 2.8 Signal-To-Noise Ratios in IQ-plots\n",
    "The signal to noise ratio states how well a signal is received compared to the underlying noise in a channel. The value can change and be very different based on different factors, such as transmission powers, distances, attentuation factors and local noise sources. In an IQ-plot, the noise \"pushes\" the received symbol in a random direction in the plot.\n",

    "### 2.8.1 PSK IQ-Plot\n",
    "In a PSK IQ-plot, the various angles of the plot are sectioned and mapped to the different symbol values. As a result, the increase of symbols reduces how much angle is allocated to each symbol value. The amount of angle area allocated per symbol can be given as $\\frac{2\\pi}{2^{bits\\_per\\_symbol}}$.\n",
    "In the following code, you can tune the power value of a signal, as well as the average power of noise affecting a signal, to see how a PSK-signal is affected by noise."

    "\n",
    "**Q2.8.1 [2 points]:** Given one specific scheme, do all points on a constellation diagram have to be equally spaced? Why or why not? <br>\n",
    "*Answer: No, they not have to be equally spaced. You could intentinally design uneequal spacing. Some benefits from this could be: More data capacity (more symbols in the same space). Better error protection so critical symbos are placed further away. * <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.8.2 [2 points]:** When adjusting the power and noise variables, how does the rate of incorrectly read messages change? Is it possible to tolerate any errors, and if so, why? <br>\n",
    "*Answer: When the power is increased an the noise is constant, there will be an increase in signal-to-noise-ratio. This will make the symbol cluster tighter and more distinct from each other in the constellation diagram. When the noise is increased relative to the power, the constellation points become more scattered. This means a decreased bir error rate. When constellations points scatter due to noise, the issues becomes overlap between different symbol regions. Modern digital systems have error correction mechanism and can in most cases handle errors to some degree. In fact, it is essential to handle errors since real communication channels will have some level of noise.* <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.8.3 [2 points]:** Is the error-rate affected by the number of bits represented in each symbol? How can this information be utilized in a real system to maximize efficiency?<br>\n",
    "*Answer: Yes, if the bits per symbol is increased, there will be more constellation points packed in the same place. This makes the idstance between points shorter, and could increase the error-rate. In real system it is possible to use adaptive modulation schemes. If systems monitors the conditions of the communication channel, it can use hugher-order modulation if maximum throughput is needed, and if the channei is degraded, the system can use for example QPSK or BPSK.* <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.8.4 [2 points]:** How do the error rates between QAM and PSK measure when using the same parameters for power, noise and bits per symbol? (Hint: Try using high signal-to-noise ratios and low signal to noise ratios)<br>\n",
    "*Answer: QAM arranges its points in a rectangular grid, while PSK distributed the points in a circular grid. QAM typically results in greater minimum distance between constellation points. When there is high signal-to-noise ratio QAM hs the best superior error rate perforamnce because of its rectuangular point distribution. When there is a low signal-to-noise ratio, the difference becomes less noticable. PSK can have some advantages because of its uniform amplitude characteristics.   *  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.8.5 [2 points]:** Some audio-resiliant signal standards utilize QPSK and 8PSK and can transmit data successfully and reliably with loss up to 30% (Due to retransmissions within the system). Given the scripts to generate IQ-plots, what signal-to-noise (power-to-noise) ratios would this signal require to function?<br>\n",
    "*Answer: The SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. QPSK - SNR ≈ 1.0, 8PSK - SNR ≈ 1.9* \n"

    "## 3.0 Multiple Access [20 points]\n",
    "Multiple Access technologies allow for multiple users to use a common medium, by sectioning the medium in various physical (or logical) dimensions and allocating sections to different users. This can either be done by statically through multiplexing, where each modem is allocated a dimension to use, or dynamically through multiple access technologies, where the modem is told which dimensions to use and can be dynamically changed.\n",
    "SEE LECTURE X\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Time-Division Multiplexing/Multiple Access\n",
    "Time-division multiplexing works by allowing different users to use the medium at different times. Time slots are allocated to the different users, where they send their data within the time-slot. The user who owns the time-slot is allowed the full throughput of the medium, which allows for relatively high datarates when sending data, but creates the need to buffer data between sending windows.\n",

    "Source: Spiceworks - https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-tdm/\n",
    "\n",
    "The differentiation between Multiplexing and Multiple Access technologies is between where the logic to assign and uphold time-slots is implemented. For all intents and purposes, for TDM/TDMA, the resulting behaviour is the same, but TDMA tends to allow for more dynamic allocation of time-slots. This allows high-priority senders to have multiple time-slots, when increases the priority sender's bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 TDM signal-generation\n",
    "The following code-block allows you to generate a set of data-streams that are multiplexed into a TDM signal. Adjusting the \"symbol_duration\", will increase or decrease the throughput of each signal."

This allows for less buffering of data, but the reduced bandwidth of each sub-channel means that only a fraction of the throughput of the total channel is allowed per user."

    "**Q3.3.1 [2 points]:** What happens to the bitrate of the combined signal when you increase the amount of users in the TDMA system? What implications does this have on the frequency in the transmitted signal? <br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br><br> In a TDMA system, the combined signal's bitrate increases as more users are added, that's because each user's data is transmitted in its own time slot within the same frame. The total bitrate of the combined signal is the sum of the bitrates of all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the bitrate increases, the required bandwidth for the transmitted signal increases as well. This is because higher bitrates mean faster transitions in the signal, which require more bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3.3.2 [2 points]:** The frequency plot of the FDMA signal shows the frequency bandwidth of the information signal when modulating the information of the different bit streams. Why would there be a limit on the amount of users for FDMA signal? *Hint:* *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_frequency_bands*<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br><br> There is a limit to the number of users in an FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) system because each user is assigned a separate frequency band for transmission. In a noisy environment, interference can cause these allocated bands to overlap, resulting in cross-talk and signal degradation. As the number of users increases, the available frequency spectrum must be divided into narrower bands, which makes it more difficult to prevent overlap and maintain signal quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3.3.3 [2 points]:** If you increase the datarate of the FDMA signal, the bandwidths of the sub-carriers start overlapping. What does this mean for the signal? (Hint: Reduce the symbol_duration to increase datarate. Section 2.8 contains hints)<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br><br> Increasing the datarate each sub-carrier requires more bandwidth to transmit the higher rate of data. When the bandwidths of the sub-carriers start overlapping, it leads to interference between adjacent channels, known as inter-channel interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3.3.4 [2 points]:** Is it possible to combine the technologies TDMA and FDMA? How would you apply such a system?<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br><br> TDMA and FDMA are technologies that could be combined, producing FTDMA (Frequency Time Division Multiple Access). In an FTDMA system, each user is assigned a specific frequency band and a time slot for their transmissions. This allows for more efficient use of the available spectrum and can help mitigate interference issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3.3.5 [2 points]:** Consider the following two scenarios in a wireless system: scenario A involves a network with variable traffic demand, where users require dynamic bandwidth allocation based on their needs, and scenario B involves a fixed, continuous transmission where simplicity and reliability are more important than flexibility.\n",
    "Which multiple access scheme (FDMA or TDMA) would be the better choice for each scenario, and why?<br>\n",
    "*Answer:*  For scenario A, TDMA would be the better choice because it allows for dynamic bandwidth allocation. In contrast, FDMA assigns fixed frequency bands to users, which may lead to inefficient use of resources when traffic patterns change.\n",
    "For scenario B, FDMA would be more suitable as it provides a simple and reliable method for continuous transmission.\n"

    "Code-Division multiple access uses the math to diversify different channels within the same bit-stream. This is accomplished by *chipping* each modem's data, which yields a chiprate that is higher than the original bitrate of the datastream.

    "**Q3.4.1 [2 points]:** What will happen to the frequency bandwidth of a signal after it goes through chipping? (Hint: What happens when you increase the amount of users to the chipping sequence and the frequency spectrum?)<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br><br> In CDMA When you increase the number of users, each with their own chipping sequence, the overall frequency spectrum used by the system remains the same, but the signals from all users overlap within this wide bandwidth. The required bandwidth for each user's signal after chipping is much greater than the original data signal, and the total system bandwidth must be large enough to accommodate all users' spread signals without excessive interference.\n",

    "**Q3.4.2 [2 points]:** What factors make CDMA costly compared to FDMA or TDMA?<br>\n",
    "*Answer:* <br>CDMA can be more costly than FDMA or TDMA due to the following factors:<br>\n",
    "1. **Complexity of Implementation:** CDMA requires more complex signal processing techniques, such as spreading and despreading, which can increase the cost of hardware and software development.\n",
    "2. **Power Control:** In CDMA, power control is essential to ensure that all users' signals are received at similar power levels. This requires additional mechanisms and can increase the overall system cost.\n",
